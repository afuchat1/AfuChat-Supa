# Overview

This project is a pnpm workspace monorepo utilizing TypeScript to develop AfuChat, a WeChat-style chat super app. AfuChat aims to provide a comprehensive communication and lifestyle platform, connecting users through chat, social features, and integrated services. The platform is designed for cross-platform compatibility, running on mobile (iOS/Android), web, and desktop.

Key capabilities include (latest: Telegram Mini App support):
- Real-time chat and social networking features (posts, stories, follows) with end-to-end encrypted direct messaging.
- Advanced AI integrations for chat, image generation, and intelligent features (AfuAi cannot access private messages).
- Clickable followers/following lists with privacy enforcement (`hide_followers_list`/`hide_following_list` settings respected).
- In-app wallet with custom currencies (Nexa/ACoin) for virtual goods, gifts, and services.
- Gamified user experience with XP rewards and in-app games.
- A marketplace for unique digital gifts.
- Extensive mini-programs for daily-life services like bill payments, airtime, and data bundles.
- A robust administrative dashboard for user and content management.

The project leverages an existing Supabase backend for data persistence and authentication, focusing on delivering a rich, interactive, and secure user experience.

# System Architecture

The project is structured as a pnpm monorepo using TypeScript, with distinct packages for deployable applications and shared libraries.

**Core Technologies:**
- **Monorepo Tool**: pnpm workspaces
- **Backend**: Express 5 API server (`artifacts/api-server`), Supabase for all data persistence, authentication, real-time, and Edge Functions. The Replit PostgreSQL database is provisioned but not used — all data lives in Supabase.
- **Frontend**: Expo React Native for mobile and web, targeting a unified codebase.
- **Validation**: Zod for API request and response validation.
- **API Codegen**: Orval from OpenAPI specification for generating API clients and Zod schemas.
- **Build**: esbuild for API server, Expo Metro bundler for mobile/web.

**Application Structure:**
- `artifacts/`: Contains deployable applications (`api-server`, `mobile`, `mockup-sandbox`).
- `lib/`: Houses shared libraries like `api-spec`, `api-client-react`, `api-zod`, and `db`.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts.

**UI/UX and Design:**
- **Branding**: AfuChat blue-green (`#00BCD4`) and gold (`#D4A853`).
- **Typography**: Inter font family.
- **Theming**: Dark/light theme support (dark uses Google-style warm greys, light uses cream tones), persisted via `AsyncStorage`.
- **App Accent Color**: User-selectable accent color via `AppAccentContext` (AsyncStorage key `app_color_theme`). Six options: Teal (#00BCD4, default), Blue (#2196F3), Purple (#9C27B0), Rose (#E91E63), Amber (#FF9800), Emerald (#4CAF50). The `useTheme()` hook returns `accent` and overrides `colors.accent/tint/tabIconSelected/online/unread`. Color picker is in the Me tab under Appearance. Static StyleSheet references use `Colors.brand` (the constant default teal); dynamic theming is applied via inline styles.
- **Liquid Glass UI**: `GlassView` component (`components/ui/GlassView.tsx`) uses `BlurView` on iOS (intensity 72+), semi-transparent fallback on Android/web. Applied to `SwipeableBottomSheet` (both mobile sheet and desktop modal), video `CommentsSheet` modal, and the `ProductTour` tooltip.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes `useWindowDimensions()` and custom `useResponsive()` hooks for dynamic layouts across web, mobile, and desktop.
- **UI Components**: Reusable components for avatars, verified badges, skeletons, offline banners, and swipeable bottom sheets.
- **Input Styling**: Consistent rounded `borderRadius: 12` for all input fields.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password, Google/GitHub OAuth, OTP-based password reset, email confirmation. Supports multi-account switching.
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with tab-based navigation and deep linking support. Tabs: AfuChat, Discover, Apps, Me. Post creation via FAB on discover page.
- **Post Visibility**: Posts have `public`, `followers`, `private` visibility. Discover feed shows posts based on visibility. Search only returns public posts.
- **Offline Support**: Offline-first architecture with `AsyncStorage` caching, message queuing, and auto-sync on reconnect. Includes network status banners.
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime for chat, notifications, presence, and discover feed updates (likes, comments, views, follows, new posts). Twitter/X-style "New posts" pill for feed updates.
- **Notifications**: Expo Push Notifications with custom sound, token management, and authenticated edge function triggers.
- **Media Handling**: Centralized media upload utility to Supabase Storage.
- **AI Features**: Advanced AI assistant (AfuAi) powered by Groq Llama-3.3-70b via Supabase Edge Functions. Features: chat history persistence (ai_conversations/ai_messages tables), history browser with search/pin/delete, full platform intelligence (pulls user posts, channels, events, marketplace, followers, bookmarks, transactions), 15 executable actions (send_nexa, send_acoin, follow, unfollow, subscribe, cancel_subscription, convert_nexa, create_post, bookmark_post, delete_post, update_bio, update_status, search_users, buy_gift, send_message), auto-conversation-titling, rich markdown rendering, action buttons, suggestion chips, invoices/receipts, and confirmation cards. System prompt includes comprehensive AfuChat encyclopedia with all platform features.
- **Monetization**: `ACoin` and `Nexa` (XP) in-app currencies, dynamic gift pricing, subscription plans, and in-app purchases.
- **Freelance Marketplace**: Professional freelance service marketplace (`app/freelance.tsx`) with: browse/search/filter by category & sort, service detail modals with reviews, ACoin payment integration via `transferAcoin`, full order workflow (pending→in_progress→delivered→revision→completed/cancelled), seller dashboard with earnings stats, create/edit listings with tags & requirements, buyer review system with star ratings, and listing management (pause/activate/delete). DB tables: `freelance_listings`, `freelance_orders`, `freelance_reviews` on Supabase.
- **Gamification**: XP rewards for user activities with cooldowns.
- **Account Management**: Soft-delete with a 30-day grace period, followed by permanent purge.
- **SEO & Deep Linking**: API server routes for public profiles and posts with SEO-friendly short IDs, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, and app link configurations.
- **Chat UX**: Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal patterns for voice messages, 60fps animations, scroll-to-bottom FAB with unread count, message spacing, date separators, empty chat state, and read receipts.
- **Chat Preferences**: `ChatPreferencesContext` (`context/ChatPreferencesContext.tsx`) provides live chat customisation — theme color (bubble color via `CHAT_THEME_COLORS`), bubble border radius (via `BUBBLE_RADIUS`), font size, typing indicators, and read receipts. Persisted to Supabase `chat_preferences` table. Provider added to root `_layout.tsx` inside `LanguageProvider`. Chat screen (`app/chat/[id].tsx`) consumes the context: message bubble color, border radius, and font size applied dynamically; typing indicator broadcasting and read receipt marking each gated by their respective preference toggles.
- **Story Viewer (Web-enabled)**: Full story viewing experience now works on web — image/video stories with progress bar, tap left/right navigation, comment input, viewer list (owner), and share. Previously blocked by a web guard; the guard has been removed since all components (`Video`, `Image`, `Animated`, `TouchableOpacity`) are web-compatible.
- **Story Camera**: Full-screen camera for story posting with Photo/Video modes, flash, camera flip, and gallery picker.
- **Story Privacy**: Privacy levels (`everyone`, `close_friends`, `only_me`) enforced by RLS and client-side filtering.
- **Story Comments**: `story_replies` table with text input at bottom of story viewer. Comments pause story timer while composing. RLS: anyone can read, authenticated users can insert/delete own.
- **Real-time Stories**: StoriesBar subscribes to Supabase Realtime INSERT events on `stories` table. New story rings appear immediately without refresh.
- **Articles & Videos (post_type system)**: Posts table supports `post`, `article`, `video` types. Article creation with title, body, audience, word count. Video creation with `expo-image-picker`, `expo-av` preview, upload to Supabase storage. Detail screens for articles and TikTok-style full-screen video player with inline autoplay.
- **Distinctive Article Cards**: Articles render with a unique card design across discover feed, profile pages, and search results. Features: cover image, badge with read time estimate, bold title, excerpt, branded "Read article" CTA button. Visually distinct from regular posts.
- **Article Detail Page**: Magazine-style layout with optional cover image + gradient overlay, article badge + read time, large title, italic subtitle (short summary), author section with date, full `article_body` content (not truncated `content`), stats row, rounded action bar (Like/Comment/Share), threaded comments. Share button in header.
- **Feed Performance & Offline**: Per-tab in-memory cache, `AsyncStorage` persistence with TTL, background fetching for silent refreshes, and auto-refresh on reconnect.
- **Adaptive Feed Algorithm**: Records user interaction weights per category to learn interests and rank posts accordingly.
- **Threaded Replies (Video Comments)**: Recursive threaded replies with indentation, "Reply" button, and `@handle` banner.
- **Music Marquee (Video Player)**: Displays audio name at the bottom of the video player.
- **Video Web Not Supported**: Video features are app-only; web shows "Videos are only available in the app" message.
- **Unique Per-User Video Views**: Views recorded in `post_views` table with unique constraint per user.
- **Cross-Platform Adaptations**: Platform-specific guards for various features.
- **Premium Tiering**: Features gated by subscription tiers (Silver, Gold) using `LockedToggle`/`LockedLink` components.
- **Onboarding**: A forced 5-step onboarding flow for new users.
- **Referral System**: Deep link-based referral system for user acquisition.

## Tier System

Tiers: `free → silver → gold → platinum`. Managed by `hooks/useTier.ts` (`hasTier(tier)` utility reads `useAuth().subscription.plan_tier`).

Gate component: `components/ui/PremiumGate.tsx` — wraps screen content, shows full-screen lock with upgrade CTA when tier is insufficient.

Applied gates:
- **Group create** (`app/group/create.tsx`) — Gold required
- **Channel create** (`app/channel/create.tsx`) — Platinum required
- **Story create** (`app/stories/create.tsx`) — Gold required
- **Monetize** (`app/monetize.tsx`) — Silver required
- **AfuAI chat tap** (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) — Platinum intercept, routes to `/premium`

## Desktop UI Overhaul (Full Desktop Experience)

`DesktopSidebar.tsx` — Fully rewritten top nav (`DesktopTopNav`):
- **Logo**: AfuChat logo + wordmark, links to Home/Discover section
- **Nav items** (left): Home, Explore, Connect▼ (Messages, Contacts, Create Group/Channel), Create▼ (Post, Article, Video, Story), Wallet▼ (My Wallet, Top Up, Transfer, Requests, Gift Vault), Apps — all with dropdown panels; auth-gated items hidden for logged-out users
- **Icon rail** (right, logged-in only): Notifications bell with live unread badge, Messages icon with live unread count badge, Match heart shortcut, Post quick-action button, Avatar dropdown menu
- **Avatar menu**: Profile, Edit, Digital ID, Achievements, Prestige, Go Premium, Username Market, Settings, Admin (if admin), theme toggle, Sign Out
- **Auth buttons** (right, logged-out): Log in + Sign up free
- **Live unread counts**: `useUnreadCounts` hook subscribes to Supabase Realtime for `notifications` and `chat_members` tables and updates badge counts in real-time
- **Apps dropdown**: 2-column grid with AfuAI, Games, Gifts, Match, Events, Marketplace, Freelance, Files, Saved, Referral

`DesktopWrapper.tsx` — Updated section routing:
- New section types: `ai | apps | match | settings`
- Auth-guard redirects to login for protected sections
- All new sections rendered

New desktop section files:
- `components/desktop/DesktopAppsSection.tsx` — Full apps launcher with category left-sidebar (Intelligence, Social, Entertainment, Finance, Marketplace, Tools, Account) and list-style app tiles with gradient icons. Shows `adminOnly` apps only to admin users.
- `components/desktop/DesktopAISection.tsx` — Full-featured AI chat interface with message history, suggestion chips, real-time streaming via Supabase channel. Uses `get_or_create_direct_chat` RPC with AfuAI bot ID.
- `components/desktop/DesktopMatchSection.tsx` — Dating/match section with profile cards (photo, bio, tags), like/pass action buttons, sidebar quick links for filters and settings. Reads from `match_profiles` and writes to `match_likes`.
- `components/desktop/DesktopSettingsSection.tsx` — Settings panel with sidebar tabs (Account, Privacy, Security, Notifications, Chats, Appearance, Language, Advanced, Danger Zone), routing to existing app routes via `router.push`.

## Desktop Contacts Section

`components/desktop/DesktopContactsSection.tsx` — two-panel desktop contacts view added to the sidebar nav ("Contacts" icon). Left panel: alphabetically grouped list of people the user follows, with search, online indicators, and "Add Contact" flow. Right panel: inline profile card showing avatar, verified badge, follower/following counts, follow toggle, Message button, and a 3-column posts grid with best-thumbnail detection. Clicking a post navigates to its detail/video page.

`DesktopWrapper.tsx` and `DesktopSidebar.tsx` updated to include the `"contacts"` section.

## Post Thumbnail Detection

All surfaces now pick the best available thumbnail using priority: `post_images[0]` → `image_url` → null.

- `contact/[id].tsx`: Video posts now render `image_url` behind the play-button overlay (previously showed a blank dark background).
- `post/[id].tsx`: Query now fetches `article_title`; article posts render a bold title above the body text in the detail view.
- `DesktopDiscoverSection.tsx`: Already correct — video card uses `image_url`, regular posts use `post_images → image_url`.

## Offline Improvements

- `lib/offlineStore.ts` — added `cacheWallet` / `getCachedWallet` (key `offline_wallet`)
- `app/wallet/index.tsx` — loads cached transactions when offline; caches on successful load; shows `OfflineBanner`
- `app/group/create.tsx`, `app/channel/create.tsx`, `app/stories/create.tsx`, `app/monetize.tsx` — `isOnline()` guard before any mutation
## Post Detail Page Redesign

`app/post/[id].tsx` — Full visual overhaul (all logic preserved):
- **Article hero**: 280px full-bleed image with `LinearGradient` overlay; article title + badge displayed on top of the gradient for a magazine-style look
- **Reading time**: Calculated from word count (`Math.ceil(words/200)`) shown in the badge row
- **Author byline**: Full-width bordered row (avatar + name + date + view count) separating hero from body
- **Image grid**: Smart `ImageGrid` component — 1 image full-width, 2 images side-by-side, 3-4 in a 2×2 tile grid with "+N" overflow badge
- **Engagement bar**: 4-column bar (Like · Replies · Views · Share) with `hairlineWidth` dividers; like count turns red when liked
- **Reply section header**: Centered divider with a badge showing reply count
- **Reply composer**: Shows user's own avatar; character counter appears at 200+ chars; turns red below 20 remaining
- **Reply card**: Nested replies get a colored left-border depth indicator; replies render in a rounded bubble
- **Context menu**: Menu items use icon badge circles (color-coded per action)

## First-Login Welcome Guide

`components/ui/WelcomeGuide.tsx` — New full-screen overlay shown once per account after first login:
- 6 swipeable slides: Welcome · Chat · Discover · AfuAI · Wallet · Community
- Each slide: `LinearGradient` background, large icon circle, title, subtitle, 3 feature bullet points
- Smooth spring entrance animation (scale + translateY)
- Top-right **Skip** button dismisses immediately
- Dot page indicators (active dot wider)
- **Next** → **Get Started** CTA button at bottom
- Stored in `AsyncStorage` key `afu_welcome_guide_v1_seen` — shown exactly once
- Wired in `(tabs)/_layout.tsx` after `onboarding_completed === true`, shows user's first name on slide 1
